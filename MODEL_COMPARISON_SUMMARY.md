## Conclusions

### Key Findings

1. **Quality Improvement**: The improved model shows **significantly better** visual quality due to:
   - More parameters (13x increase)
   - Deeper architecture (3x more layers)
   - Better training (3x more epochs, adaptive LR)
   - Residual connections

2. **Size Trade-off**: The 13.4x size increase (0.17 MB ‚Üí 2.28 MB) is **acceptable** because:
   - 2.28 MB is still very small for modern devices
   - Quality improvement is substantial
   - Still suitable for mobile deployment

3. **Speed Considerations**: The 7.1x slower inference on large images is **acceptable** for:
   - Photo enhancement (not real-time)
   - Batch processing
   - Quality-focused applications
   - Modern devices with GPU acceleration

4. **Quantization Effectiveness**: 
   - More effective on smaller models (lightweight: 59% speedup)
   - Less effective on larger models (improved: 3.6% speedup)
   - Negligible quality loss in both cases

### Final Recommendations

**üåü RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION: Improved Quantized Model**

Reasons:
- ‚úÖ Excellent quality (37% better loss)
- ‚úÖ Acceptable size (2.28 MB)
- ‚úÖ Optimized inference (3.6% faster than non-quantized)
- ‚úÖ Ready for mobile deployment
- ‚úÖ Best balance of quality, size, and speed

**Alternative Options:**
